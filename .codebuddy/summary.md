# Project Summary

## Overview of Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
The project is primarily developed using the Go programming language (Golang). The project utilizes the following frameworks and libraries:
- **Go Modules**: Managed through `go.mod` and `go.sum` files for dependency management.
- **MongoDB**: The project appears to interact with MongoDB, as indicated by the presence of a `mongo.go` file in the internal database directory.

## Purpose of the Project
The specific purpose of the project is not explicitly stated, but based on the file names, it seems to involve handling user registration and possibly integration with Slack, suggesting that it may be a web application or service that manages user interactions and data storage.

## List of Configuration and Build Files
- `go.mod`: This file defines the module's dependencies, versioning, and module name.
- `go.sum`: This file contains the checksums for the module dependencies listed in `go.mod`, ensuring the integrity of the modules.

## Directories for Source Files
- Source files can be found in the following directories:
  - `/handlers`: Contains handler files such as `register.go` and `slack.go`.
  - `/internal/db`: Contains database-related files, specifically `mongo.go`.
  - The main application entry point is located in `/` with the `main.go` file.

## Location of Documentation Files
There are no specific documentation files mentioned in the provided file structure. If documentation exists, it may be located in a separate directory or within comments in the source code files.
